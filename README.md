# A Showcase of My Cybersecurity Journey:
This portfolio highlights my experiences and progress in cybersecurity, especially through the Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges on Hack The Box. These challenges have been an important part of my learning, helping me develop practical skills in areas like network enumeration, exploitation, and problem-solving.

Through these challenges, I've had the opportunity to work with various tools and techniques, gaining hands-on experience in scanning networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, and learning how to approach different types of security issues. Each challenge has taught me more about how networks function, how to identify weaknesses, and how to use different strategies to solve problems.

This showcase reflects my ongoing journey to better understand cybersecurity, and it's a way to share the progress I've made so far. While there's still a lot to learn, these experiences have helped me improve my skills and gain confidence in tackling new challenges.
