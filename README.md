# A Showcase of My Cybersecurity Journey:
This portfolio showcases my journey and growth in cybersecurity, particularly through the Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges on Hack The Box. These challenges have played a key role in my learning, helping me build practical skills in network enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. I'm focused on understanding the techniques used by hackers, with the goal of applying these skills to strengthen the security posture of the company I'll be working with.

As I tackled these challenges, I gained hands-on experience with various tools and techniques, improving my ability to scan networks, analyze vulnerabilities, and address different security issues. Each challenge has deepened my understanding of network functions, vulnerability identification, and effective defense strategies.

This portfolio reflects my ongoing pursuit of cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a way to share the progress I've made. While there's still much to learn, these experiences have strengthened my skills and boosted my confidence in handling new security challenges.
